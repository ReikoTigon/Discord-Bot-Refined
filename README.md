# Discord-Bot-Refined

This is the bot with the minimal functionality.

It connects to Discord.
It has a Exit-Command in the Console, so you can stop the bot.

Just add your Discord Token to the DONOTOPEN.json

If using the .jar:
Create a .json file with the name DONOTOPEN.json and put

```
[
	{
		"token": "YOUR TOKEN HERE"
	}
]
```

in it. The file has to be located in the same directory as the .jar file!
